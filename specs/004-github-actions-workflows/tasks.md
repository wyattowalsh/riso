# Tasks: GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflows

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-github-actions-workflows/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Only automated validation checks explicitly called out in requirements (actionlint validation, workflow generation smoke tests).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This feature uses template composition pattern. Workflow files are Jinja2 templates in `template/files/shared/.github/workflows/` that render into downstream projects.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

1. **Setup (Phase 1)** → No dependencies - can start immediately
2. **Foundational (Phase 2)** → Depends on Setup (Phase 1) - **BLOCKS all user stories**
3. **User Story 1 (Phase 3)** → Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - MVP baseline
4. **User Story 2 (Phase 4)** → Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Can run parallel with US1
5. **User Story 3 (Phase 5)** → Depends on US1 and US2 (modifies their workflows) - Must complete US1/US2 first
6. **User Story 4 (Phase 6)** → Depends on US1 (enhances artifact strategy) - Can integrate during US1 or after
7. **User Story 5 (Phase 7)** → Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Can run parallel with US1/US2
8. **Polish (Phase 8)** → Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: No dependencies on other stories - MVP starting point
- **US2 (P2)**: Independent of US1 - can develop in parallel
- **US3 (P2)**: Enhances US1 and US2 workflows - must complete those first to add caching
- **US4 (P3)**: Enhances US1 artifacts - can integrate during US1 implementation
- **US5 (P3)**: Independent workflow job - can develop in parallel with US1/US2

### Within Each User Story

- Workflow template creation before validation
- Template validation before sample rendering
- Sample rendering before smoke test updates
- Documentation can proceed in parallel with implementation

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase**: T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel

**Foundational Phase**: T007, T008 can run in parallel after T005, T006 complete

**User Story 1**: After T009 completes, T010-T013, T018, T022-T023 can run in parallel. T014-T017 and T019-T021 follow sequentially.

**User Story 2**: After T024 completes, T033, T036-T037 can run in parallel. Matrix implementation T025-T032 must be sequential.

**User Story 3**: T038-T042 (caching implementation) can all run in parallel. T043-T047 (documentation and metrics) can run in parallel.

**User Story 4**: All artifact enhancement tasks T048-T055 can run in parallel.

**User Story 5**: After T056 completes, T064-T065, T068 can run in parallel. Node.js implementation T057-T063 and validation T066-T067 follow sequentially.

**Polish Phase**: T069-T071, T073-T076 can all run in parallel. T077-T080 must run sequentially at the end.

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] labels**: Map tasks to specific user stories for traceability
- **Constitution compliance**: All workflows use `uv run` commands, 90-day retention, distinctive naming
- **Independent testing**: Each user story should be testable without others
- **Validation gates**: actionlint must pass before sample render is considered successful
- **Smoke tests**: Update after each story phase to track workflow generation health
- **Artifact strategy**: Implemented in US1, enhanced in US4 - can be done together if preferred
- **Caching strategy**: Must come after US1/US2 since it modifies their workflow templates

**Tasks Generated**: 81 tasks across 8 phases
**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 (T001-T023) = 23 tasks
**Parallel Opportunities**: 35 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
**Estimated Completion Time**: 11 hours (MVP), 27 hours (full feature)
