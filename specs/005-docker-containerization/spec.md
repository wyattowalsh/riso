# Feature Specification: Container & Docker Support

**Feature Branch**: `005-docker-containerization`  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Container & Docker Support - Add optional Docker and docker-compose support with multi-stage builds, production-ready configurations, development containers, and deployment-ready images for all module combinations"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Production-Ready Container Images (Priority: P1)

A developer builds a container image from a rendered project using multi-stage Dockerfile, resulting in optimized production image under 200MB that runs the application securely with non-root user and health checks.

**Why this priority**: Containerization is foundational for modern deployments. Without production-ready images, projects cannot deploy to cloud platforms, Kubernetes, or container orchestration systems.

**Independent Test**: Build container image from rendered project, inspect image size and layers, run container, verify application responds to health check endpoint, confirm process runs as non-root user.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a rendered project with Docker enabled, **When** running `docker build`, **Then** image builds successfully in under 5 minutes with final size under 200MB.
2. **Given** a built container image, **When** starting the container, **Then** application starts within 10 seconds and responds to health check requests.
3. **Given** a running container, **When** inspecting the process, **Then** application runs as non-root user with minimal capabilities.

### User Story 2 - Local Development with Docker Compose (Priority: P2)

A team member clones a rendered project and runs `docker-compose up` to start the full application stack (app, database, cache) in an isolated environment without installing dependencies on their machine.

**Why this priority**: Docker Compose enables consistent local development environments across team members, eliminating "works on my machine" problems and reducing onboarding time.

**Independent Test**: Clone rendered project, run `docker-compose up`, verify all services start successfully, confirm application connects to dependent services, test hot reload when editing code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a rendered project with docker-compose.yml, **When** running `docker-compose up`, **Then** all services (app, postgres, redis if configured) start and reach healthy state.
2. **Given** running docker-compose environment, **When** editing application code, **Then** changes reflect within 5 seconds via volume mounts and hot reload.
3. **Given** docker-compose stack running, **When** shutting down with `docker-compose down`, **Then** all containers and networks clean up without orphaned resources.

---

### User Story 3 - VS Code Dev Containers (Priority: P2)

A developer opens a rendered project in VS Code, launches the dev container, and immediately has a fully configured development environment with all tools, extensions, and dependencies pre-installed.

**Why this priority**: Dev containers provide the ultimate "one-click setup" experience, fulfilling the template's goal of minimizing setup time while ensuring consistent tooling across contributors.

**Independent Test**: Open rendered project in VS Code, click "Reopen in Container", wait for build, verify Python/Node environments are configured, run tests, confirm debugging works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a rendered project with .devcontainer/ config, **When** opening in VS Code and selecting "Reopen in Container", **Then** dev container builds and opens terminal with working Python/Node environments.
2. **Given** active dev container, **When** running quality suite commands, **Then** all tools (ruff, mypy, pylint, pytest) execute successfully.
3. **Given** dev container environment, **When** setting breakpoints and running debugger, **Then** VS Code debugger attaches and pauses at breakpoints.

---

### User Story 4 - Multi-Stage Build Optimization (Priority: P3)

A CI pipeline builds container images using multi-stage Dockerfile that separates build dependencies from runtime dependencies, reducing final image size by 70% compared to single-stage builds.

**Why this priority**: Multi-stage builds significantly reduce image size and attack surface, improving deployment speed and security. Lower priority because basic containerization works without it.

**Independent Test**: Build image with multi-stage Dockerfile, compare size to hypothetical single-stage build, verify build artifacts don't appear in final image, test that runtime image contains only necessary dependencies.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multi-stage Dockerfile with build and runtime stages, **When** building image, **Then** final stage contains only runtime dependencies, no build tools or source files.
2. **Given** completed multi-stage build, **When** inspecting image layers, **Then** build stage artifacts (compilers, dev headers) are absent from final image.
3. **Given** optimized runtime image, **When** starting container, **Then** application runs successfully despite minimal installed packages.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when docker-compose includes services the project doesn't use based on module selection (skip unused services)?
- How does system handle Apple Silicon (M1/M2) vs Intel platform differences (use buildx multi-platform builds)?
- What if user lacks Doc
**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** mulfast with clear error messages)?
- How are secrets handled in containers (document environment variable injection, never bake secrets into images)?
- What about container image tagging and versioning strategies (provide semver-based tagging guidance)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001 (B)**: Template MUST generate Dockerfile using multi-stage builds s3. **Give build dependencies from runtime dependencies, targeting Python 3.11+ base images.
- **FR-002 (B)**: Dockerfile MUST configure non-root user for application process, drop unnecessary capabilities, and include HEALTHCHECK directive.
- **FR-003 (B)**: Template MUST generate docker-compose.yml orchestrating application service plus optional services (postgres, redis) based on project requirements, with health checks and restart policies.
- **FR-004 (B)**: Template MUST generate .dockerignore excluding development files, caches, secrets, and build artifacts to minimize build context.
- **FR-005 (O)**: When dev containers enabled, template MUST generate .devcontainer/devcontainer.json configuring VS Code development environment with extensions, settings, and tool installations.
- **FR-006 (O)**: When dev containers enabled, template MUST configure volume mounts for hot reload during development while maintaining isolated dependencies.
- **FR-007 (B)**: Container configurations MUST adapt based on enabled modules (skip postgres service if no database usage, include Node.js in dev container only when api_tracks includes node).
- **FR-008 (B)**: Template MUST provide container build and run documentation in README with commands for local development and production deployments.
- **FR-009 (B)**: Dockerfile MUST use layer caching optimizations (copy dependency files before source code, leverage buildkit caching).
- **FR-010 (O)**: Template MUST generate GitHub Actions workflow for building and pushing container images to registry (GitHub Container Registry) on releases.
- **FR-011 (B)**: docker-compose.yml MUST define networks isolating services and volumes persisting data across container restarts.
- **FR-012 (B)**: Container health checks MUST verify application readiness, integrating with API health endpoints when available.

### Template Prompts & Variants

- **Prompt**: `container_support` — **Type**: Optional — **Default**: `disabled` — **Implication**: Enables Docker, docker-compose, and dev container scaffolding with module-aware configurations.
- **Sub-prompt**: `dev_containers` — **Type**: Optional — **Default**: `enabled` (when container_support enabled) — **Implication**: Generates VS Code .devcontainer/ configuration.
- **Existing Prompt Integration**: `api_tracks`, `cli_module`, `mcp_module` — **Modified**: Container configs adapt entrypoints, exposed ports, and installed dependencies based on enabled modules.

### Key Entities

- **ContainerImage**: Represents built Docker image with tags, size, layers, base image reference, and security scan res- **FR-012 (B)**: Container health checks MUST verifyice topology with service dependencies, network isolation, volume mounts, and health check configurations.
- **DevContainerConfig**: Captures VS Code dev container settings including base image, extensions, post-create commands, and mount confi- **Suons.
- **ContainerHealthCheck**: Specifies health check command, interval, timeout, and retry logic for monitoring container readiness.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes
- ***SC-001**: Container images for rendered projects build successfully in under 5 minutes and result in production images under 200MB.

- **SC-006**: Hot reload in docker-compose development environments reflects code changes within 5 seconds for 95% of edits.
- **SC-007**: Container security scans show zero critical vulnerabilities in base images and application dependencies.

## Assumptions

- Docker Engine 20.10+ available on developer machines and CI runners; Docker Desktop acceptable for local development.
- VS Code is the primary IDE for teams using dev containers; other IDEs require manual configuration.
- Production deployments target container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, ECS, Cloud Run) or PaaS with container support.
- Projects accept opinionated base images (python:3.11-slim, node:20-alpine) optimized for security and size.
- Development docker-compose stacks assume local development only; production orchestration handled separately.

## Dependencies & External Inputs

- Official Python and Node.js container base images from Docker Hub.
- Docker Compose specification v3.8+ for service orchestration.
- VS Code Dev Containers extension and specification.
- Container registry access for pushing images (GitHub Container Registry, Docker Hub, or private registries).
- Container security scanning tools (trivy, grype) for vulnerability assessment.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Large container images consume excessive bandwidth and storage. **Mitigation**: Multi-stage builds, layer caching, alpine base images where appropriate, document image optimization best practices.
- **Risk**: Platform differences (ARM vs x86) cause build failures. **Mitigation**: Use Docker buildx for multi-platform builds, test on both architectures in CI.
- **Risk**: Dev containers slow on machines with limited resources. **Mitigation**: Document minimum requirements (8GB RAM, SSD storage), provide lightweight configuration options.
- **Risk**: Secrets accidentally baked into images. **Mitigation**: .dockerignore templates exclude .env files, documentation emphasizes runtime secret injection, container scan checks for leaked secrets.
- **Risk**: Hot reload fails for certain file types or module configurations. **Mitigation**: Document volume mount patterns, provide troubleshooting guides for common hot reload issues.

## Out of Scope

- Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, or advanced orchestration configs (covered in deployment targets feature).
- Container image signing and attestation beyond basic SBOM generation (covered in security/DevSecOps feature).
- Production-grade service mesh, ingress controllers, or load balancing (platform-specific, handled during deployment).
- Database migration automation within containers (application-level concern, not template scaffolding).
- Multi-region container registry replication or CDN integration (infrastructure concern, not template feature).
