# Tasks: Riso Template Foundation

**Input**: Design documents from `/.specify/specs/001-build-riso-template/`  (legacy symlink available at `specs/001-build-riso-template/`)  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Include explicit test scaffolds only when required to validate the user stories‚Äô acceptance criteria.

**Constitution Gates**: Regenerate template samples, refresh documentation, and prove governance automation prior to closing the feature.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story so each increment remains independently testable.

## Phase 6: User Story 4 ‚Äì Governance Automation Protects Releases (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Ensure automated checks enforce constitutional compliance for every template change.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Phase Order**: Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí Polish. Each phase depends on completion of its predecessor.
- **Story Independence**: US1 delivers the MVP baseline; US2, US3, and US4 rely on foundational work and build atop US1 artifacts but remain independently testable after their prerequisites finish.
- **Shared Files**: template/hooks/post_gen_project.py, scripts/render-samples.sh, scripts/ci/render_matrix.py, scripts/ci/run_baseline_quickstart.py, scripts/ci/verify_context_sync.py, scripts/ci/record_module_success.py, and scripts/ci/track_doc_publish.py evolve across phases‚Äîapply changes sequentially to avoid conflicts.
- **Automation Flow**: scripts/ci/render_matrix.py feeds compliance scripts, baseline timing checks, success-rate recording, and documentation SLA tracking; update it before wiring governance tasks.

---

## Parallel Execution Examples

- **US1 (P1)**: T013‚ÄìT017 can proceed in parallel across separate modules before sequencing T018‚ÄìT022.
- **US2 (P2)**: Develop code scaffolds T026‚ÄìT037 simultaneously while another contributor records sample prompts T038‚ÄìT039 and extends automation T040.
- **US3 (P3)**: T041‚ÄìT043 can be divided among engineers, with T044‚ÄìT046 following once blueprints are ready.
- **US4 (P4)**: Build compliance tooling T047‚ÄìT050 concurrently, then update CI workflow T051 before finalizing evidence tasks T052‚ÄìT053.

---

## Implementation Strategy

- **MVP First**: Complete Phases 1‚Äì2, deliver US1 (T012‚ÄìT022), and validate the baseline quickstart with recorded timing evidence to establish a releasable MVP.
- **Incremental Delivery**: Add US2 to unlock optional modules, then US3 for layout flexibility, and US4 for governance automation‚Äîvalidating renders, success metrics, and documentation after each phase.
- **Parallel Teams**: After foundational work, assign engineers per story using the parallel examples while coordinating shared automation files.
- **Validation Cadence**: After each story, run scripts/render-samples.sh, scripts/ci/run_baseline_quickstart.py, scripts/ci/verify_context_sync.py, scripts/ci/record_module_success.py, scripts/ci/track_doc_publish.py, and scripts/compliance/checkpoints.py to capture deterministic evidence before progressing.
