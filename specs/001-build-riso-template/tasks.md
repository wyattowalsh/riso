# Tasks: Riso Template Foundation

**Input**: Design documents from `/.specify/specs/001-build-riso-template/`  (legacy symlink available at `specs/001-build-riso-template/`)  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Include explicit test scaffolds only when required to validate the user stories’ acceptance criteria.

**Constitution Gates**: Regenerate template samples, refresh documentation, and prove governance automation prior to closing the feature.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story so each increment remains independently testable.

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Establish template skeleton, metadata, and documentation placeholders.

- [X] T001 Create template source directories in template/prompts/, template/hooks/, and template/files/ per implementation plan.
- [X] T002 Document default stack metadata and prompts in template/copier.yml.
- [X] T003 [P] Scaffold sample automation stub scripts/render-samples.sh.
- [X] T004 [P] Initialize documentation placeholders docs/modules/.keep and docs/upgrade-guide/.keep for upcoming content.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Provide shared prompts, macros, context syncing, and automation hooks that every story depends on.

## Phase 4: User Story 2 – Optional Modules Compose (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Allow any combination of CLI, FastAPI, Fastify, FastMCP, docs site, and shared logic modules to interoperate without conflicts.  
**Independent Test**: Script renders toggling each module solo and in combined scenarios, run module-specific smoke commands (CLI invocation, FastAPI/Fastify tests, MCP tool validation, docs preview), and ensure all succeed.

## Phase 5: User Story 3 – Multi-Layout Support (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Offer single-package and monorepo layouts without rework for downstream teams.  
**Independent Test**: Render in single-package and monorepo modes, run layout-specific bootstrap scripts (uv sync, pnpm install), and confirm automation + docs adjust for each selection.

## Phase 6: User Story 4 – Governance Automation Protects Releases (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Ensure automated checks enforce constitutional compliance for every template change.  
**Independent Test**: Trigger CI on a template modification; verify render matrix, docs build, compliance checkpoints, baseline timing metrics, and module success-rate checks block merges until samples and docs refresh.

### Implementation for User Story 4

**Checkpoint**: Governance automation enforces template sovereignty, deterministic generation, and documentation parity.

---

## Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Align documentation, upgrade guidance, SLA tracking, and release validation across all stories.

- [X] T057 [P] Add docs/modules/sample-matrix.md.jinja summarizing samples/default/, samples/cli-docs/, samples/api-monorepo/, and samples/full-stack/.
- [X] T058 Execute scripts/render-samples.sh, scripts/ci/run_baseline_quickstart.py, scripts/ci/verify_context_sync.py, scripts/ci/record_module_success.py, scripts/ci/track_doc_publish.py, and scripts/compliance/checkpoints.py, recording outputs in samples/README.md for release readiness.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Phase Order**: Setup → Foundational → US1 → US2 → US3 → US4 → Polish. Each phase depends on completion of its predecessor.
- **Story Independence**: US1 delivers the MVP baseline; US2, US3, and US4 rely on foundational work and build atop US1 artifacts but remain independently testable after their prerequisites finish.
- **Shared Files**: template/hooks/post_gen_project.py, scripts/render-samples.sh, scripts/ci/render_matrix.py, scripts/ci/run_baseline_quickstart.py, scripts/ci/verify_context_sync.py, scripts/ci/record_module_success.py, and scripts/ci/track_doc_publish.py evolve across phases—apply changes sequentially to avoid conflicts.
- **Automation Flow**: scripts/ci/render_matrix.py feeds compliance scripts, baseline timing checks, success-rate recording, and documentation SLA tracking; update it before wiring governance tasks.

---

## Parallel Execution Examples

- **US1 (P1)**: T013–T017 can proceed in parallel across separate modules before sequencing T018–T022.
- **US2 (P2)**: Develop code scaffolds T026–T037 simultaneously while another contributor records sample prompts T038–T039 and extends automation T040.
- **US3 (P3)**: T041–T043 can be divided among engineers, with T044–T046 following once blueprints are ready.
- **US4 (P4)**: Build compliance tooling T047–T050 concurrently, then update CI workflow T051 before finalizing evidence tasks T052–T053.

---

## Implementation Strategy

- **MVP First**: Complete Phases 1–2, deliver US1 (T012–T022), and validate the baseline quickstart with recorded timing evidence to establish a releasable MVP.
- **Incremental Delivery**: Add US2 to unlock optional modules, then US3 for layout flexibility, and US4 for governance automation—validating renders, success metrics, and documentation after each phase.
- **Parallel Teams**: After foundational work, assign engineers per story using the parallel examples while coordinating shared automation files.
- **Validation Cadence**: After each story, run scripts/render-samples.sh, scripts/ci/run_baseline_quickstart.py, scripts/ci/verify_context_sync.py, scripts/ci/record_module_success.py, scripts/ci/track_doc_publish.py, and scripts/compliance/checkpoints.py to capture deterministic evidence before progressing.
