# Shared Logic Module

Enable `shared_logic=enabled` to expose reusable helpers in `shared/logic/__init__.py` (Python) and
`shared-config/logic.ts` (TypeScript). These utilities keep CLI and API modules consistent without
duplicating business rules.

## Highlights

- `build_health_payload()` standardises health responses across services.
- `summarize_payload()` and `summarizeStatus()` provide human-friendly summaries for logs.
- `HealthCheckResult` captures structured health metadata for reuse by automation.

Use the shared logic module as the foundation for domain-specific calculations that multiple modules
consume.
