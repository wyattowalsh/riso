# Quickstart

Welcome to **{{ project_name }}**, the baseline render produced by the Riso template.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 (managed through [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv))
- pnpm 8+

## Bootstrap

```bash
uv sync
uv run python -m {{ package_name }}.quickstart
make quality
# or, if make is unavailable
uv run task quality
```

The quickstart script executes pytest, ruff, mypy, and pylint. The `quality` target chains all
quality tools (linting, typing, coverage) and records durations in `.riso/quality-durations.json`
for governance evidence. The `uv run task quality` fallback relies on the bundled Taskipy
definition so environments without `make` stay aligned.

## Optional Modules

- Enable `cli_module=enabled` to scaffold a Typer CLI with Vitest smoke tests.
- Enable `api_tracks=python` or `api_tracks=node` for FastAPI or Fastify services.
- Enable `mcp_module=enabled` for FastMCP tooling.

Refer to `docs/modules/prompt-reference.md` for compatibility details.
